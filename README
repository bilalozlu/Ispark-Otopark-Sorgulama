Application url: https://bilals-park-space.herokuapp.com

*This application uses an API supplied by İBB (https://api.ibb.gov.tr/ispark/Park) 
and shows available park spaces of İşpark in İstanbul

*I used NodeJS for back-end (handling fetch and adjusting API results)
and Embedded JavaScript for front-end side (rendering GUI with HTML/Javascript).

*Only choosing district and park name is enough to use app.

*Since I did not upload node_modules, you need to install them
by `npm install` command in order to run application in your computer.
