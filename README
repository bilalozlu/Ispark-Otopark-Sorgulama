Application url: https://bilals-park-space.herokuapp.com

*API is supplied by İBB (https://api.ibb.gov.tr/ispark/Park)

*I used NodeJS for back-end (handling fetch and adjusting API results),
Embedded JavaScript for front-end side (rendering GUI with HTML/Javascript),
and LeafLet to implement map (https://leafletjs.com/)

*Since I did not upload node_modules, you need to install them
by `npm install` command in order to run application in your computer.
